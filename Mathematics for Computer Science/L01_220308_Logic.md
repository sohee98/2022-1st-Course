* Higher Order Logic
  * Second/Third... Order Logic



### 1. Propositional Logic 명제 논리

* Proposition is a statement that is either True or False 명제는 참이나 거짓인 진술이다.

  * English sentencesd can be propositions (Today is rainy...)

* Propositional Logic
  * A mathematical system for reasoning about propositions and how they relate each other 명제사 서로 어떻게 관련되어있는지 추론하기 위한 수학적 시스템

* Every statement in propositional logic consists of propositional variables and (propositional, logic) connectives that combine propositional variables **명제 변수+접속사**

* #### Boolean Algebra

  * Arithmetic deals with numbers and Algebra deals with variables
  * We can focus on analysis and manipulation of the structure 구조의 분석과 조작
  * Mathematicians and logicians did the same thing that algebra does for arithmetic
    * Arithmetic(Numbers w/operators) => Algebra (Variables) 
    * T,F with connectives => Boolean Algebra (Variables)

* #### Propositional Variables 명제 변수

  * Each proposition will be represented by a propositional variable
    각 명제는 명제 변수로 표시됨
  * Variables are usually represented as lower-case italic letters, such as *p, q, r, s* 
    명제는 소문자 기울임 꼴로 표시됨
    * p : “Today is rainy” 

  * As a proposition, each variable can take one of two values: True or False

* #### Propositional Connectives 명제 접속사

  * there are 7 (or 5) connectives
  * ![image-20220308152312875](md-images/image-20220308152312875.png)
  * Logical "NOT" : ￢
    * Change T to F and vice versa
  * Logical "AND" : ∧
    * p ∧ q = T if both p and q are T / 둘다 T
  * Logical "OR" : ∨
    * p ∨ q = T if at least one of p or q are T

* Inclusive / Exclusive OR

  * The ∨ connective is an "inclusive OR"

    * True if at least one of two operands is true / 적어도 한개 T

  * Exclusive OR : ⊕ 

    > 배타적 논리합. XOR

    * True if and only if exactly one of two operands is True / 한개만 T
    * p ⊕ q = (not(p) and q) or (p and not(q)) , not(p iff q)



* #### Implication

  * p implies q : p → q

    * If p is True, then q is True

  * Construct the truth table of p → q

    > Vacuously True, Vacuous Truth

* #### Biconditional

  * "p if and only if q" : p ↔ q  `(둘다 T or F)`

  * "p iff q"

  * p ↔ q : (p → q) ∧ (q → p)

  * | p    | q    | p ↔ q |
    | ---- | ---- | ----- |
    | T    | T    | T     |
    | T    | F    | F     |
    | F    | T    | F     |
    | F    | F    | T     |

  

  * Example : If you work hard (p), then you will get an A+ (q)

  * | p(you work hard) | q(Get an A+) | p → q | p ↔ q |
    | ---------------- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
    | Work hard        | Get an A+    | T     | T     |
    | Work hard        | Get a D      | F     | F     |
    | Play hard        | Get an A+    | T     | F     |
    | Play hard        | Get a D      | T     | T     |

  

* #### Precedence 우선순위

  * How to parse this statement? ￢p → q ∨ r → p ∨ q ∧ r
    (￢p) → (q ∨ r) → (p ∨ (q ∧ r))
  * Operator precedence 연산자 우선순위
    * ￢
    * ∧
    * ∨
    * →
    * ↔
  * All operators are right-associative (오른쪽에서 왼쪽으로 처리)
  * [x] Use parentheses to disambiguate (괄호 사용해 명확하게 함)

* #### De Morgan's Laws

  * ￢(p ∧ q) is equivalent to ￢p ∨ ￢q

* #### Important Equivalences

  * p → q is equivalent to ￢(p ∧ ￢q) = not(p) or not(not(q)) = not(p) or q
  * ￢(p → q) is equivalent to ?? not(p imply q) = not(not(p) or q) = p and not(q) = p ∧￢q
  * **p → q is equivalent to ￢(p ∧￢q)  => ￢p ∨q** 
  * If p is False, ￢p ∨q is True
    IF p i True, then q must be True for the whole expression to be True

* **Cautions**

  * English sentences and logical connectives sometimes may have different meanings
  * **p if q** is equivalent to **q → p**
  * ex. (Women passengers) **AND** (Passengers less than 15 years old) will take lifeboats
  * p : It rained
    q : there is some sunshine
    r : I will see rainbow
    * If it rained, **but** there is no sunshine, then I will not see rainbow
    * (p and not(q)) implies not(r)



### 2. First-Order Logic(FOL)

* Definition : A logic system for reasoning about properties of objects

* Tools that augment the logical connectives from propositional logic

  * Predicates : Describe properties of objects 서술어
  * Function: Map objects to another object 
  * Quantifier: Allow to reason about multiple objects

* #### (Constant) Symbol, Predicate

  ![image-20220308160135829](md-images/image-20220308160135829.png)

  * **Constant Symbols** : Refer to objects, not propositions (명제가 아닌 객체)

  * **Predicates**: Take objects as arguments and evaluate to T or F (객체를 인수로, T/F)

    => Evaluation results of predicates can be considered as propositions

    => Connect them with propositional connectives 명제 접속사로 연결

* #### Reasoning about Objects 객체에 대한 추론

  * Predicate is to reasoning about objects 
       **Predicate는 객체에 대한 추론이다.**
  * Example - Delicious (Macaron) , BelongsTo (Seoul, Korea)
  * Applying a predicate to arguments produces a proposition, which is either True or False 인수에 서술어를 적용하면 T/F인 명제 생성
  * In FOL, a list of predicates with specifications will be provided
  * Specifications
    * Definitions, functionalities
    * Types and numbers of arguments they take
  
* #### First-Order Sentences

  * Sentences is FOL can be constructed from predicates applied to objects
    문장은 객체에 적용된 서술어로 구성된 FOL 이다.

  * ![image-20220308160559285](md-images/image-20220308160559285.png)

    > lessThan(x, 2022)

  * < is a predicate
    Binary predicates may written in an ***infix*** notation (중위표기법)

  * Numbers and strings are constant symbols like "You" and "a"

* #### Equality

  * FOL is equipped with a special predicate "="
    * check whether two objects are the same or not
  * Equality is a connective like → and ∨ (접속사이다.)
  * Example
    * MichaelJordan = BasketballPlayer
    * Sun = Moon
  * Note : Equality can be applied to objects only (= 객체에만 적용)
    * ↔ for equality of two propositions (명제에는 ↔)

* #### Functions 함수

  * Functions take objects as input and produces an objects as output 
    **함수는 입력, 출력을 객체로 함**
  * Examples
    * YougestOf(SNU) ≠ YougestOf(Kentech)
    * SteepestAscentOf( FavoriteTrailOf(You) )
    * MinimumOf(x,y,z)
    * x + y = plus(x, y)
  * As with predicates, functions can take in any number of arguments, but always return a single value (Object) (함수는 여러 인수를 사용할 수 있지만, 항상 단일값을 반환함)
  * Functions evaluate to **objects**, not propositions(명제)
    함수는 명제가 아닌 **객체**로 평가됨

* #### Objects & Predicates
  
  * Caution: always keep objects (actual things) and propositions (T or F) seperate
  * Cannot apply connectives to objects 객체에 접속사를 적용할 수 없음
    * Moon ↔ Sun 
  * Cannot apply functions to propositions 명제에 함수를 적용할 수 없음
    * YoungestOf( IsMacaron(a) = IsIceCream(a) ) 
  
* ### Type Checking Table

* #### Existential Quantifier(존재한정자) : ∃ 

  * A statement of the form 

    ​	∃x. some-formula

    is True if there exist a choice of x where some-formula if True when that x is plugged into it
    => 원소중 하나라도 명제를 참(T)으로 만족하면 명제함수는 참(T)가 된다.
  
  * Examples
  
    * ∃x.(Even (x) ∧ Prime (x))
      ∃x.(짝수(x) and 소수(x))
    * ∃x.(SmarterThan(x, Einstein) ∧ LessFamousThan(x, Einstein))
    * (∃x.Smiling(x)) → (∃ y.WearingHat(y))
      한명이라도 웃고있음=T → 아무도 모자 없음=F ⇒ False

* #### Universal Quantifier(전체한정자) : ∀

  * A statement of the form 
    	∀x. some-formula 
    is True if for every choice of x, 
    the statement some-formula is True when that x is plugged into it
    => 모든 원소가 그 명제를 참(T)으로 만족할 경우에만 명제함수가 참(T)

  * Examples 
    * ∀x. (IsMacaron (x) → Delicious (x))
    * For any natural number n, n is even if and only if n^2 is even
      ∀𝑛. (n ∈ ℕ→ (Even (n) ↔ Even (n^2 ) ))
