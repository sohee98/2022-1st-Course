## NFA

* Nondeterministic Finite Automata
* Structurally similar to a DFA, but represents a fundamental shift in how we'll think about computation

* (Non)determinism
  * A model of computation is deterministic if at every point in the computation, there is exactly one choice that can make
    * The machine accepts if that series of choices leads to an accepting state
  * A model of computation is nondeterministic if the computing machine has a finite number of choices available to make at each point, possibly including zero
  * The machine accepts if any series of choices leads to an accepting state 
    * This sort of nondeterminism is technically called existential nondeterminism

* A simple NFA

* #### …õ-Transitions

  * NFAs have special type of transition called the …õ-transition

  * An NFA may follow any number of …õ-transitions at any time without consuming any input

### NFA Intuition

* Intuiting Nondeterminism
  * Nondeterministic machines are a serious departure from physical computers
    * How can we build up an intuition for them?
  * There are two particularly useful frameworks for interpreting nondeterminism: 
    * Perfect positive guessing
    * Massive parallelism

#### - Perfect Positive Guessing

* ![image-20220322152116049](md-images/image-20220322152116049.png)
* We can view nondeterministic machines as having Magic Superpowers that enable them to guess choices that lead to an accepting state
  * If there is at least one choice that leads to an accepting state, the machine will guess it
* There is no known way to physically model this intuition of nondeterminism

#### - Massive Parallelism

* <img src="md-images/image-20220322152224060.png" alt="image-20220322152224060" style="zoom:50%;" /><img src="md-images/image-20220322152234560.png" alt="image-20220322152234560" style="zoom:50%;" />
*  <img src="md-images/image-20220322152250610.png" alt="image-20220322152250610" style="zoom:50%;" />
* An NFA can be thought of as a DFA that can be in many states at once
* At each point in time, when the NFA needs to follow a transition, it tries all the options at the same time
* Procedure
  * Start off in the set of all states formed by taking the start state and including each state that can be reached by zero or more - transitions
  * When you read a symbol a in a set of states S: 
    * Form the set S' of states that can be reached by following a single a transition from some state in S
    * Your new set of states is the set of states in S', plus the states reachable from S' by following zero or more …õ-transitions



### NFA Design

* Designing NFAs
  * Embrace the nondeterminism!
  * Good model: Guess-and-check:
    * Is there some information that you'd really like to have? Have the machine nondeterministically guess that information
    * Then, have the machine deterministically check that the choice was correct
  * The guess phase corresponds to trying lots of different options
  * The check phase corresponds to filtering out bad guesses or wrong options.

## NFA ‚â° DFA ?

#### DFA and NFA

* Any language that can be accepted by a DFA can be accepted by an NFA 
* Why? => Every DFA essentially already is an NFA! 
* How about the reverse?
* Can any language accepted by an NFA also be accepted by a DFA? 
* Surprisingly, the answer is yes! 
* To prove this, we need to:
  * Pick an arbitrary NFA 
  * Describe how we would construct a DFA with the same language (in a generalizable way)

#### The Subset Construction

* This procedure for turning an NFA for a language L into a DFA for a language L is called the subset construction
  * Or powerset construction
* Intuitively:
  * Each state in the DFA corresponds to a set of states from the NFA
  * Each transition in the DFA corresponds to what transitions would be taken in the NFA when using the massive parallel
  * The accepting states in the DFA correspond to which sets of states would be considered accepting in the NFA when using the massive parallel
* Explore more on Subset Construction with elaborate examples involving …õ-transitions and cases where the NFA dies
* In converting an NFA to a DFA, the DFA's states correspond to sets of NFA states
* Useful fact: |‚Ñò(S)| = 2 ^|ùëÜ| for any finite set S 
  * |ùëÜ| = N
  * ‚Ñò(S) : Power sets from a set S
* In the worst-case, the construction can result in a DFA that is exponentially larger than the original NFA 
* Question to ponder: Can you find a family of languages that have NFAs of size n, but no DFAs of size less than 2 ^|ùëõ| ?



#### Important Theorem

* Theorem : A language L is regular if and only if there is some NFA N such that ‚Ñí (N) = L

* Proof
  * ‚Üí Part is easy 
    * Pick a language L that is regular 
      * That means there's a DFA D where ‚Ñí(D) = L 
      * Every DFA is "basically" and NFA, so there's an NFA (D) whose language is L 
  * ‚Üê Part is also easy
    * Next, assume there's an NFA N such that ‚Ñí(N) = L 
    * Using the subset construction, we can build a DFA D where ‚Ñí ( N) = ‚Ñí (D) 
    * Then we have that ‚Ñí (D) = L, so L is regular.



#### Perspectives on RL

* We now have two perspectives on regular languages 
  * Regular languages are languages accepted by DFAs 
  * Regular languages are languages accepted by NFAs 
* We can now reason about the regular languages in two different ways

#### Union of Two Languages

* If L1 and L2 are languages over the alphabet ‚àë, the language L1 ‚à™ L2 is the language of all strings in at least one of the two languages
* Question : If L1 and L2 are regular languages, is L1 ‚à™ L2?
* <img src="md-images/image-20220322154206106.png" alt="image-20220322154206106" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Intersection of Two Languages

* If L1 and L2 are languages over ‚àë, then L1 ‚à© L2 is the language of strings both L1 and L2
* Question : If L1 and L2 are regular, is L1 ‚à© L2 regular as well?
* <img src="md-images/image-20220322154444710.png" alt="image-20220322154444710" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### String Concatenation

*  If w ‚àà ‚àë* and x ‚àà ‚àë*, the **concatenation** of w and x, denoted wx, is the string formed by tacking all the characters of x onto the end of w 
  * Example: if w = quo and x = kka, the concatenation wx = quokka 
* This is analogous to the + operator for strings in many programming languages 
* Some facts about concatenation: 
  * The empty string …õ is the identity element for concatenation
    * W…õ = …õW = W 
  * Concatenation is associative: wxy = w(xy) = (wx)y

#### Language Concatenation

* The concatenation of two languages L‚ÇÅ and L‚ÇÇ over the alphabet ‚àë is the language 
  L‚ÇÅL‚ÇÇ = { wx ‚àà ‚àë* | w ‚àà L‚ÇÅ ‚àß x ‚àà L‚ÇÇ }

  <img src="md-images/image-20220322154843189.png" alt="image-20220322154843189" style="zoom:67%;" />



#### Two Perspectives of ConCatenation

* The set of all strings that can be made by concatenating a string in L‚ÇÅ with a string in L‚ÇÇ 
* The set of strings that can be split into two pieces: a piece from L‚ÇÅ and a piece from L‚ÇÇ? 

> This is closely related to, but different than, the Cartesian product. 
> Question to ponder: In what ways are concatenations similar to Cartesian products? In what ways are they different?



#### Concatenating Regular Languages

* If L1 and L2 are regular languages, is L1L2?

* Intuition - can we split a string w into two strings xy such that x ‚àà L1 and y ‚àà L2?

  <img src="md-images/image-20220322155131545.png" alt="image-20220322155131545" style="zoom:67%;" />

* Idea

  * Run a DFA/NFA for L1 on w.
  * Whenever it reaches an accepting state, optionally hand the rest of w to a DFA/NFA for L2 
  * If the automaton for L2 accepts the rest, w ‚àà L‚ÇÅL‚ÇÇ. 
  * If the automaton for L2 rejects the remainder, the split was incorrect.



#### Concatenation

#### Language Exponentiation

* We can define what it means to "exponentiate" a language as follows:

#### The Kleene Closure

 <img src="md-images/image-20220322155411777.png" alt="image-20220322155411777" style="zoom:80%;" />



#### Reasoning about Infinity

* If L is regular, is L* necessarily regular?
  * ùêø0 = {…õ} is regular
  * ùêø1 = L is regular 
  * ùêø2 = LL is regular 
  * ùêø3 = L(LL) is regular  ...
* Regular languages are closed under union 
* So the union of all these languages is regular.

* Reasoning about Infinite
  * If a series of finite objects all have some property, the "limit" of that process does not necessarily have that property 
  * In general, it is not safe to conclude that some property that always holds in the finite case must hold in the infinite case (This is why calculus is interesting) 
  * So our earlier argument (L* = L0 ‚à™ L1‚à™ ...) isn't going to work 
  * We need a different line of reasoning


#### The Kleene Star

* Idea : Can we directly convert an NFA for language L to an NFA for language L*?
