## (Mobile vs. Fixed Sensing Cases)



### Sensor Data Gathering & Processing

* Getting sensor data 
  * From which sensors? (e.g., motion sensors, current sensors) 
  * From where? Phone (wearable) vs. factory (stationary) 
  * How? (e.g., wireless or wired, hierarchical?) 
* Processing sensor data
  * Why? For what? (e.g., activity recognition or fault detection) 활동인식, 오류감지
  * How (procedure)
    * Sensor data processing pipeline: collect 🡪 segment 🡪 extract추출 🡪 classify분류 
      (데이터가 너무 많아서 segment를 생성해야 함)

* **Data Acquisition & Pre-processing** 데이터 수집, 전처리
  * Collecting a stream of sensor data (e.g., using Android’s sensor manager interface)
  * Since most sensors provide data on some regular basis, we also need to know **sampling rate** (will learn more about this during DSP sessions)
  * An accelerometer, for example, may provide a stream of tuples of real numbers representing the acceleration in x, y and z-direction with 5 Hz 
  * Cf) Android’s sensing rate configuration
    * Predefined rates: SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL, UI, GAME, FASTEST 
      * Or, the desired delay between events in microseconds
    * Actual rate is device-dependent; e.g., Nexus 5 (Normal/UI: 15 Hz; Game: 50 Hz; Fastest: 200 Hz)
    * Note that your smart devices will not guarantee such rates, and actual rate is dependent on its operating conditions (e.g., workload) 

* **Data Segmentation**

  * For feature extraction, we need to “identify” those data segments that are likely to contain information about activities (known as “activity detection” or “spotting) 

    * **Sliding window**: using a window (=frame) of samples, and simply slide that window with fixed overlapping (e.g., 50%) 
    * Energy based: different activities have different activity “intensities” (or energy) (e.g., rest vs. others) – moving avg. can be used for automatic segmentation 

  * In our example, to recognize basic physical activities we collect the data of 2 seconds from the accelerometer. 

  * This corresponds to 10 readings of the acceleration data (if sampling rate is fixed to 5Hz)

* **Feature Extraction** 특징 추출

  * How to extract features? 

    * Signal-based features – mean, variance, kurtosis 
    * Body model features – exploiting prior knowledge about human kinematics 
    * Event-based features – if there are any events (e.g., a sequence of eye movements – saccades, fixations, or blinks) 
    * Multilevel features – duration, frequency, co-occurrence, clustered data/labels 

  * In our examples, we extract the following features:

    * Average value of accelerometer’s y-axis signals
    * Variance of accelerometer sensor signals 

    ![image-20220308102253874](md-images/image-20220308102253874.png)

* **Classification** 분류

  * After extracting important features from the raw data, we use a classifier to determine the current activity

  * Many different classification algorithms exist, and depending on the application domain, there may be one algorithm that shows the best performance 

  * Depending on the algorithm, the result is either a crisp decision (e.g., decision tree), or a probability distribution over activities (e.g., Naïve Bayes) 

  * Learning algorithms: supervised vs. unsupervised (based on whether training dataset is used or not)
